      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        When visitors leave reviews on the site we collect the data shown in the reviews form, and also the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string
        to help spam detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The
        Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your review, your review is visible to
        the public.
      </p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is
        discarded when you close your browser.
      </p>
      <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
      <p>
        If you leave a review, the review and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments
        automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or
        delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their email). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
      </p>
      <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
      <p>
        If you have an account on this site, or have left reviews, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you,
        including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we
        are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
